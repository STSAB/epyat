epyat
=====

Fork of epyat at https://code.google.com/p/epyat/, originally written by
Patrick Strobel.

This API is designed to be loaded onto Telit GSM/GPRS modules with build in
Python interpreters (e. g. GM862). It abstracts from the AT-commands and
provides simple function-/method-calls for these commands
(like SMS.send(...)).
